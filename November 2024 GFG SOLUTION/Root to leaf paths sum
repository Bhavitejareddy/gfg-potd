Root to leaf paths sum
Given a binary tree, where every node value is a number. Find the sum of all the numbers that are formed from root to leaf paths. 
The formation of the numbers would be like 10*parent + current (see the examples for more clarification).

Code:

class Solution {
   public static int help(Node root,int num){
        if(root==null)return 0;
        num = num*10+root.data;
        if(root.left==null && root.right==null)return num;
        return help(root.left,num)+help(root.right,num);
    }
    public static int treePathsSum(Node root) {
        // add code here.
        return help(root,0);
    }
}

Time Complexity:- O(N)
Space Complexity:- O(H)
