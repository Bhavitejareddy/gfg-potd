Mirror Tree
Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.
Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     

Code:
class Solution {
    void mirror(Node node) {
        solve(node);
    }
    Node solve(Node node){
        if(node == null){
            return null;
        }
        Node m_left = solve(node.left);
        Node m_right = solve(node.right);
        node.left = m_right;
        node.right = m_left;
        return node;
    }
}
