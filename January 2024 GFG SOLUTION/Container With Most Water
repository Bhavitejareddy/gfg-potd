Container With Most Water
Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, 
find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.
Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

Code:

class Solution {

    public int maxWater(int arr[]) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length-1;
        int max_area = 0;
        while(left<right){
            int height = Math.min(arr[left],arr[right]);
            int width = right - left;
            int area = height*width;
            
            max_area = Math.max(max_area,area);
            if(arr[left] < arr[right]){
                left++;
            }else{
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max_area;
    }
}
