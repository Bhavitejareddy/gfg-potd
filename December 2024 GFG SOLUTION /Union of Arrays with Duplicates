Union of Arrays with Duplicates
Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.

The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element occurrence should be there in the union.

Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.

Code:

class Solution {
    public static int findUnion(int a[], int b[]) {
        // Create a HashSet to store unique elements
        HashSet<Integer> unionSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Add all elements from the first array to the set
        for (int num : a) {
            unionSet.add(num);
        }
        
        // Add all elements from the second array to the set
        for (int num : b) {
            unionSet.add(num);
        }
        
        // The size of the HashSet is the count of unique elements in the union
        return unionSet.size();
    }
}
