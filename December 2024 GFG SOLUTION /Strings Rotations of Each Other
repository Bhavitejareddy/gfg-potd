Strings Rotations of Each Other
You are given two strings of equal lengths, s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

Note: The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

Code:
class Solution {
    // Function to check if two strings are rotations of each other or not.
    public static boolean areRotations(String s1, String s2) {
        // Check if lengths are different
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check if s2 is a substring of s1 + s1
        String concatenated = s1 + s1;
        return concatenated.contains(s2);
    }
}
