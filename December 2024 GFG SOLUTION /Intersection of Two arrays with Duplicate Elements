Intersection of Two arrays with Duplicate Elements

Given two integer arrays a[] and b[], you have to find the intersection of the two arrays. Intersection of two arrays is said to be elements that are common in both arrays. The intersection should not have duplicate elements and the result should contain items in any order.

Note: The driver code will sort the resulting array in increasing order before printing.

Code:

class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> intersectionWithDuplicates(int[] a, int[] b) {
        // Use hash sets to find the unique intersection
        HashSet<Integer> setA = new HashSet<>();
        HashSet<Integer> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Add all elements of array 'a' to setA
        for (int num : a) {
            setA.add(num);
        }
        
        // Check if elements of 'b' are in setA, and add them to resultSet
        for (int num : b) {
            if (setA.contains(num)) {
                resultSet.add(num); // Ensures no duplicates in the result
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the resultSet to an ArrayList
        return new ArrayList<>(resultSet);
    }
}
